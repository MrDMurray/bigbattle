# Big Battle

A simple browser-based UI to manage large battles in D&D.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser. Use the form at the top to add new NPC groups by
specifying a name, how many NPCs are in the group and their maximum health. Each
NPC appears in the grid with a health bar showing its current health.
